aprilcube-xxx.fig / aprilcube-xxx.pdf: xfig drawings and
exported PDFs for building paper cubes with a different
tag on each face. Just print at the suitable size,
cut out, and glue together. 

Of course, for better stability glue the paper around
a suitable block of foam or wood.

Note: the images referenced are from the folder
tams_apriltags/Media/materials/textures/large36h11/
To change the figures, copy the .fig files into that
folder and edit there.
